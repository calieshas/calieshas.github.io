        <h2>Water Drop Project</h2>
        
        <p>For this project you need:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Camera</li>
        <li>Tripod</li>
        <li>glass 9X13 pan</li>
        <li>colorful paper (this can be solid or multicolored)</li>
        <li>flashlight</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>ziplock bag</li>
        <li>pen or pencil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This project must be set up in a darkened room. First you need to put your pan on a table or desk and fill it almost to the top with water. Then, prop up your colorful paper behind it standing up at a 90&deg; angle. Next, you will need to put your flashlight somewhere where it can point directly at your colorful paper and not give off to much light anywhere else. After you have this set up put your camera on your tripod and make it about level with the pan so you can shoot the drops straight on or just slightly above. You will now need to put some water in your ziplock bag and hang it above the pan of water. When you are ready poke a VERY small hole in the bag. You don't want the water to come out to fast. The water in the pan needs time to settle before the next drip. You may need help with this next part, to focus your camera on the right spot, stand the pen or pencil in the water right where the drops are landing. Then manually focus on the pencil right where it meets the water. </p> 
        <p>Once this is done you are ready to start adjusting your settings. You will have to play with the settings a bit. The shutter speed is probably most important, keep it fairly low so that the drops are sharp and clear, you don't want a blurry trail following your water. The aperture should be open wide (a small number), so that the drop is in focus but the background is more blurred. Set the ISO as low as you can while still achieving good lighting so that your photos aren't to grainy. If your camera is capable of continuous shooting, that will be the easiest way to capture the drop. If you don't have continuous shooting you will have to practice to get the timing right. The most important thing for this project is patience, it will take a few tries to get the pictures you want. Try different settings, switch out your backgrounds, and just have fun! </p>

        <p>To vary your results you can use milk and food coloring to switch up the texture and color of the drops.</p>
