				<h2>Audience</h2>
				<p> The audience for this website will be anyone who wants to learn photography, the most common visitors will probably be young adults. They will be people from all over, but if they are visiting for the Star page they will either be from a rural area or be visiting a rural are so that they can capture the stars without light polution. It will be a mobile first site. I will make it accessible by mobile devices because a lot of people will probably want to be able to look at the settings on their phone while they are taking pictures. </p>

				<h2>Purpose Statement</h2>

				<p>The purpose of this website is to give begginer photographers a simple explanation of how to take pictures with manual settings. This website will hopefully make the basics understandable. As I started photography I always looked for a website like this but never found it so hopefully I can give people what they are looking for. </p>
