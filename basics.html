        <h2>Basics of Photography</h2>
        
        <h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
        <p>Shutter speed is how fast the shutter of the camera opens and closes. This is part of what determines how much light is let in. The smaller the shutter speed the faster it opens and closes. Shutter speed is measured in seconds and fractions of a second. The whole time the shutter is open it is gathering light and collecting the picture. To find where to adjust the shutter speed on your camera look for a fraction, or for a number with " behind it.
        </p>
        <p>When you are photographing sports your shutter speed should be very fast because the longer your camera is collecting the image the more streaked your picture will look. The athletes will have a blur behind them. Since the shutter speed is faster your picture may be darker, so you will have to adjust your aperture to compensate for the light. When the subject in the piture is not moving you can have a higher longer shutter speed.  </p>
        
        <p>The two images below are a good representation of shutter speed, the first one was taken with a very slow shutter speed so the puppies are blurry. The second was taken with a fast shutter speed so the dog is not so blurry.</p>

            <figcaption class="caption" id="bclear"></figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        
        <h3>ISO</h3>
        <p>ISO determines how "noisy" the picture is. If the ISO is too high the picture will look grainy. In the picture below you can see that even though the lighting is good and it is in focus, the picture is a little grainy, this is because the ISO is too high. The average camera ISO ranges from 100 to 6400, 6400 being the noisiest, some very good cameras go even higher. </p>
        
        <figure class="image">
            <picture class="iso-noise">
            <source srcset="final-web-project/images/good-rose-350.jpg" media="(max-width: 350px)">
            <source srcset="final-web-project/images/good-rose-500.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">

            </picture>
            <figcaption class="caption" id="bisorose"></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Aperture</h3>
        <p>Apetrure controls the size of the lense opening. The smaller the aperture the bigger the opening, and the bigger the opening the more light that comes in. On your camera the aperture is showed as an f-number, also known as f-stop. The aperture also determines how much of the picture is in focus the bigger the opening the more blured the background is, the smaller the opening the sharper the background will be. In the pictures below you can see that in the first one, the background is blurred out but the rose is in focus. In the second picture the whole thing is more focussed, theres not one specific focal point. </p>
        
        <figure class="image">
            <picture class="aperture-small">

        </figure>
        
        <h3>Manual Focus</h3>
        <p>When you focus your photos manually you can choose what part of the picture you want to be in focus, sometimes you want different things in focus. These two images demonstrate this very well. The first one you can see the front of the picture is more in focus, where the second picture is focused further back. The focus is usually adjusted by twisting the lense.  </p>
        
        <figure class="image">
            <picture class="close-focus">
            <source srcset="final-web-project/images/close-focus-350.jpg" media="(max-width: 350px)">

        </figure>
        
        <figure class="image">
            <picture class="far-focus">
            <source srcset="final-web-project/images/far-focus-350.jpg" media="(max-width: 350px)">
            <source srcset="final-web-project/images/far-focus-500.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">

        </figure>
        
        <p>Each of these aspects of your photo just take some experimentation. You have to get used to the settings and just practice a bit, after a while you will have a pretty good idea of what settings you should use in different lighting situations. </p>
