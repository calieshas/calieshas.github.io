A very large percentage of the shoppers at downeast will be between between the ages of 15-25. This site is very trendy and upbeat, but they keep it fairly simple.

				<h2>Site Contrast</h2>
<!--Did they or did they not know who their target audience was?
Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience?
Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found?
Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment?-->
				<p> Downeast knows exactly who their target audience is. They feature young women modeling their clothing on the home page so that young women who go to their website see those girls and imagine themselves in those clothes. They make shopping there very appealing! They meet the needs of their audience by making the site easy to navigate and very accesible to anyone. This website is not very "clicky", you don't have to travel to, and load, five different pages to get where you are going. The navigation list drops down and you just click once or twice on the things you are interested in, and you are where you want to go in an instant without having to load any other pages. It is a very good set up for mobile web surfing!  </p>
