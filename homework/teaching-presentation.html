        <p>Margins and Padding</p>
        <img alt="slide2" src="/images/slide2.jpg">
        <p>Margins and padding give your content a cushion to sit inside of so that it is not all jumbled together. It serves as a border between objects. </p>
        <img alt="slide3" src="/images/slide3.jpg">
        <p>In this slide you cannot tell where the margin and padding divide. This is because without a border there really is no separation between the two. </p>
        <img alt="slide4" src="/images/slide4.jpg">
        <p>We see in this slide that the padding is only 5px while the margin is 55px. You can see where the padding and margin split because of the added border. </p>
        <img alt="slide5" src="/images/slide5.jpg">
        <p>We can set margins and padding using CSS. As seen in this slide, we do this by selecting the object we want to add a margin and padding to, then we use the margin, padding, and border tags to set them to the size we want. Just setting a margin or padding with a number of pixels makes it the same size all the way around. However, we can change that and make each side a different size as shown in the slide. The last example is the shorthand for setting margins. When using shorthand the order of the sides must be: top, right, bottom, left. We can remember this by thinking of the word trouble. </p>
        <img alt="slide6" src="/images/slide6.jpg">
        <p> Margins provide empty space on the OUTSIDE of the border. </p>
        <img alt="slide7" src="/images/slide7.jpg">
        <p>Padding gives us a cushion on the INSIDE of the border. </p>
        <img alt="slide8" src="/images/slide8.jpg">
        <p>If you apply a border is gives you separation between the margin and the padding. </p>
        <img alt="slide9" src="/images/slide9.jpg">
        <p> When calculating screen size and trying to figure out how wide to make everything on your page, don't forget to take into consideration the extra pixel width from the margin, border, and padding. If you forget about the extra width you will end up with to much width on the page and it will mess up the whole layout because it will move things down so that nothing is overlapping. </p>
        <img alt="slide10" src="/images/slide10.jpg">
        <p> In this slide you can see that I applied a margin, border, and padding to the whole body, this shows the diffent pieces quite clearly.</p>
